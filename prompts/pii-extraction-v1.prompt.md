# PII Extraction Prompt v1

## Purpose

Extract ALL personally identifiable information from a conversation chunk. This creates a comprehensive identity graph for each person mentioned, enabling cross-channel identity resolution through identifier collisions.

## Input

- **Channel**: The communication channel (iMessage, Gmail, Discord, etc.)
- **Primary Contact**: The person whose conversation this is (name + identifier)
- **User**: The owner of the comms database
- **Messages**: A chunk of conversation (typically 50-100 messages or a logical conversation unit)

## Task

Extract ALL PII for EVERY person mentioned in this conversation:
1. **The primary contact** - the person the user is communicating with
2. **The user themselves** - any PII about the user mentioned in the conversation
3. **Third parties** - any other people mentioned (family, friends, colleagues, etc.)

For each piece of information:
- Quote the exact evidence from the messages
- Indicate confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Note whether this is self-disclosed or mentioned by someone else

## Important Rules

1. **Extract EVERYTHING** - Even small details can help with identity resolution later
2. **Quote exact evidence** - Always include the message text that supports each extraction
3. **Attribute correctly** - Be very careful about WHO each piece of PII belongs to
4. **Flag sensitive data** - Mark SSN, financial, medical info as sensitive
5. **Note self-disclosure** - Mark when someone explicitly shares their own info vs being mentioned
6. **Create new identity candidates** - If a third party is mentioned with enough detail, flag them
7. **Confidence levels**:
   - **high**: Explicitly stated or very clear
   - **medium**: Strongly implied or partially stated
   - **low**: Inferred or uncertain
8. **Don't hallucinate** - Only extract what's actually in the messages
