# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-11
Project: comms — Unified Communications Cartographer

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Add reusable patterns here as you discover them -->

- SQLite: Use modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, no CGO)
- Config: YAML in ~/.config/comms/config.yaml (use internal/config package)
- Data: SQLite in ~/Library/Application Support/Comms/comms.db
- JSON output: All commands support --json flag via Result struct
- Errors: Return structured errors with ok: false in JSON mode
- Adapters: Each adapter implements Adapter interface (Name(), Sync(ctx, db, full))
- Eve DB path: ~/Library/Application Support/Eve/eve.db
- gogcli: Call via exec, parse JSON output
- Schema: Use //go:embed to embed schema.sql into binary
- XDG paths: config.GetConfigDir() and config.GetDataDir() handle platform differences
- Foreign keys: Must enable PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON for each connection
- Read-only DB access: `sql.Open("sqlite", "file:path?mode=ro")`
- Upserts: Use `ON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE SET ...` for idempotent inserts
- Sync watermarks: Track last_sync_at per adapter in sync_watermarks table for incremental sync
- Identity resolution: Map external IDs via identities table (channel+identifier -> person_id)
- Tags: Use 'type:value' format, validate type against enum (topic, entity, emotion, project, context)
- Bulk operations: Reuse filter patterns across commands (EventFilter for both query and tag)
- DB query: Default read-only (SELECT only), use --write flag for mutations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Dynamic SQL results: Use []map[string]interface{} with rows.Columns() for flexible schema handling
- External commands: Use exec.LookPath() to validate availability, exec.CommandContext() for execution
- Gmail sync: Use 'after:YYYY/MM/DD' query format, timestamps in milliseconds (divide by 1000)
- Email parsing: Handle "Name <email>" format by extracting text between < and >
- Type assertions: Use two-value ok pattern when reading map[string]interface{}

  - Use sql.NullString for nullable database fields (display_name, relationship_type)
  - google/uuid package for generating unique IDs (already in go.mod as indirect dependency)
  - Commands should validate input early (e.g., require at least one flag)
  - When checking for existing rows, use sql.ErrNoRows to distinguish "not found" from other errors
  - Identity conflicts should be detected and reported clearly (e.g., identifier already belongs to another person)
  - SetMeName handles both create (if no me person exists) and update (if exists) cases
  - AddIdentity creates me person with empty name if needed (name can be set later)
  - Use time.Now().Unix() for storing timestamps as INTEGER in SQLite
  - Result structs with OK bool and optional fields work well for both JSON and text output

  - Event participants need role: sender, recipient, cc, observer
  - When checking if insert vs update happened, query back the ID after ON CONFLICT
  - NewEveAdapter() constructor validates Eve database exists before creating adapter
  - Adapter returns SyncResult with counts: EventsCreated, EventsUpdated, PersonsCreated, Duration

---

## 2026-01-11 - US-007 Sync command orchestrates adapter sync
- Created internal/sync package with SyncAll and SyncOne orchestration functions
- Implemented `comms sync` command that runs all enabled adapters
- Added `--adapter <name>` flag to sync specific adapter only
- Added `--full` flag to force complete re-sync (ignores watermarks)
- Sync operations handle errors gracefully - one adapter failing doesn't stop others
- Results show events created/updated, persons created, and duration per adapter
- JSON output support via --json flag for machine-readable results
- **Files changed:**
  - internal/sync/sync.go (new)
  - cmd/comms/main.go (added sync command)

  - When running multiple operations, collect results and report all at once
  - One failing adapter shouldn't prevent others from running (graceful degradation)
  - Switch statement in syncAdapter() maps adapter type to constructor
  - AdapterResult struct tracks per-adapter success/failure with detailed stats
  - Duration.String() provides human-readable time format (e.g., "2.5s", "100ms")
  - Exit with error code if any adapter fails, but still show all results
  - Config validation happens before sync (check adapter exists and is enabled)

- Implemented `comms identify merge <person1> <person2>` for union-find style merging
- Implemented `comms identify add <person> --email/--phone/--identifier` to add identities
- Merge operation transfers all identities and event_participants from person2 to person1
- Duplicate detection prevents conflicting identity assignments
- Cannot merge 'me' person into another person (must be the merge target)
- All commands support JSON output via --json flag
- **Files changed:**
  - internal/identify/identify.go (new)
  - cmd/comms/main.go (added identify command with merge and add subcommands)
  - AGENTS.md (added identity resolution patterns)

  - Use `ON CONFLICT(event_id, person_id, role) DO NOTHING` when transferring event_participants
  - Search with LIKE + LOWER() for case-insensitive fuzzy matching across names and identifiers
  - GetPersonByName matches both canonical_name and display_name for flexibility
  - Joining with event_participants and counting gives useful stats for merge prioritization
  - Merge validation: check if either person is 'me' before allowing merge
  - Custom identifiers use 'channel:identifier' format parsed with strings.SplitN
  - List query orders by event_count DESC for most active contacts first
  - Display event count and last_event_at timestamp to help users identify active contacts
  - Merge is destructive - all person2 data transferred then person2 deleted
  - Transaction pattern ensures atomicity: transfer identities, transfer participants, delete person

  - All filters are ANDed together in WHERE clause for precise filtering
  - Default limit of 100 prevents overwhelming output on large datasets
  - time.Parse("2006-01-02", dateStr) parses YYYY-MM-DD dates to time.Time
  - Load related data (participants) in separate query to keep main query simple
  - COALESCE(display_name, canonical_name) prioritizes display name in output
  - ORDER BY timestamp DESC shows most recent events first
  - Separate getEventParticipants function allows reuse and cleaner code structure
  - FormatTimestamp helper uses "2006-01-02 15:04:05" layout for human-readable dates
  - Text output shows filter description when filters applied
  - Validate direction enum (sent/received/observed) early before querying
  - Result struct includes both Count and Events array for JSON consumers

---

## 2026-01-11 - US-010 People command lists contacts
- Implemented `comms people` command with three modes: list all, search, and person detail
- List mode: `comms people` shows all contacts sorted by event count (DESC)
- Top N mode: `comms people --top 20` limits to top N contacts by event count
- Search mode: `comms people --search 'term'` searches by name or identifier
- Detail mode: `comms people 'Name'` shows full details for a specific person
- All modes support JSON output via --json flag
- Reuses identify package functions (ListAll, Search, GetPersonByName) for consistency
- **Files changed:**
  - cmd/comms/main.go (added people command with list/search/detail modes)
  - AGENTS.md (added people command patterns)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (marked US-010 as passing)
- **Learnings:**
  - Reusing existing packages reduces duplication - identify package already had all needed functions
  - Cobra Args: cobra.MaximumNArgs(1) allows 0 or 1 positional argument
  - Mode switching: check len(args) to distinguish list mode (no args) from detail mode (1 arg)
  - --top N flag is simple to implement when results are already sorted by desired field
  - Text output formatting: inline identities for list view (channel:identifier), detailed for detail view
  - Display name formatting: show [display_name] if different from canonical_name
  - Event statistics add context: show event count and last event timestamp in listings
  - Consistent Result struct pattern works well across all commands

  - SQLite DATE() function with 'unixepoch' and 'localtime' modifiers groups timestamps by day
  - Flexible date parsing: Try multiple time.Parse layouts in sequence (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, YYYY)
  - Time range boundaries: Use time.Date() with AddDate() for precise start/end (exclusive end)
  - Week calculation: Convert Sunday from 0 to 7, then subtract (weekday-1) to find Monday
  - Map-based aggregation: Use map[string]int for counting by sender/channel/direction
  - Two-pass query pattern: First pass for detailed breakdown, second pass for accurate totals
  - Avoid shadowing err variable in if statements - declare once at function level or use := each time
  - cobra.MaximumNArgs(1) allows optional positional argument (0 or 1)
  - Flag precedence: Check --today, then --week, then positional arg for flexible UX
  - Empty results handling: Show helpful "No events found" message instead of empty output

---

## 2026-01-11 - US-012 Tags command for soft tagging
- Created internal/tag package with ListAll, ListByType, ListByEvent, Add, AddBulk, Delete functions
- Implemented `comms tag list` command with optional --type filter
- Implemented `comms tag add` command with two modes:
  - Single event mode: --event <id> --tag <type:value>
  - Bulk mode: --person/--channel/--since/--until filters with --tag <type:value>
- Tag types are validated against enum: topic, entity, emotion, project, context
- Tags use 'type:value' format (e.g., 'project:htaa', 'context:business')

  - Tag validation should happen early - check tag type against valid enum before database operations
  - Duplicate detection query: `SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM tags WHERE event_id = ? AND tag_type = ? AND value = ?)`
  - Bulk tagging reuses EventFilter pattern from query package for consistency
  - buildEventFilterQuery() builds dynamic SQL based on provided filters (person, channel, time range)
  - Skip duplicates silently in bulk mode - don't fail entire operation if one event already has the tag
  - Tag list shows event preview (channel, content snippet) for context when viewing tags
  - TagWithEvent struct joins tags with events table for richer display in list command
  - Use sql.NullFloat64 for optional confidence field that can be NULL
  - SplitN with limit 2 for parsing 'type:value' allows colons in value part
  - Return count of events tagged in bulk mode for user feedback

- Converts []byte values to strings when appropriate for text fields
- **Files changed:**
  - cmd/comms/main.go (added db command with query subcommand)
  - AGENTS.md (added raw SQL query examples and patterns)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (marked US-013 as passing)
- **Learnings:**
  - Mutation detection pattern: Check uppercase SQL with strings.HasPrefix for safety keywords
  - Dynamic query results: Use []interface{} for values and []interface{} for value pointers when scanning
  - Type assertion for []byte to string conversion needed for text fields from SQLite
  - rows.Columns() provides column names dynamically for any query
  - cobra.ExactArgs(1) ensures exactly one positional argument (the SQL query)
  - Text output uses strings.Join with tab separator for simple table formatting
  - Result struct with Rows []map[string]interface{} allows flexible JSON output
  - Safety-first approach: Require explicit --write flag for mutations prevents accidents
  - Error handling at each step: db open, query execution, column retrieval, row scanning
  - defer rows.Close() and defer database.Close() ensure cleanup even on errors

  - No raw LLM JSON completion storage - facets ARE the parsed output (saves storage, simplifies queries)
  - UNIQUE(analysis_type_id, conversation_id) constraint ensures one analysis run per conversation per type
  - Facets table has CASCADE delete on both analysis_run_id and conversation_id for automatic cleanup
  - person_id on facets allows attribution: "who mentioned this entity/topic"
  - confidence and metadata_json fields support nuanced extraction results
  - Five indexes on facets table enable efficient queries by type+value, conversation, analysis run, person, and value
  - Design follows schema document section 6 exactly - generic, extensible, queryable without schema migrations
  - Adding new analysis types requires only INSERT into analysis_types, no schema changes
  - analysis_runs.status tracks lifecycle: pending → running → completed/failed/blocked
  - retry_count and error_message fields support robust error handling and retry logic

## 2026-01-13 - US-020 Add embeddings table to schema
- Added embeddings table to schema.sql with all required fields from design document
- Created table with: id (PK), entity_type, entity_id, model, embedding_blob (BLOB), dimension, source_text_hash, created_at
- Added UNIQUE constraint on (entity_type, entity_id, model) to allow same entity with multiple models
- Created two indexes: idx_embeddings_entity (entity_type+entity_id) and idx_embeddings_model
- Incremented schema version from 8 to 9
- Verified go build succeeds
- **Files changed:**
  - internal/db/schema.sql (added embeddings table and indexes, incremented version to 9)
  - scripts/ralph/prd.json (marked US-020 as passing)
  - AGENTS.md (added embeddings patterns to Gotchas and updated Schema Quick Reference)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (added US-020 learnings)
- **Learnings:**
  - Embeddings table matches schema design document section 7 exactly
  - Positioned embeddings table after analysis framework tables for logical grouping
  - entity_type enum supports: event, conversation, facet, person, thread (any entity can be embedded)
  - embedding_blob stores binary vector as little-endian float64 array (BLOB type in SQLite)
  - dimension field records vector dimensionality (768, 1024, etc.) for proper deserialization
  - source_text_hash enables change detection - can check if source changed and re-embed if needed
  - UNIQUE(entity_type, entity_id, model) allows same entity embedded with different models side-by-side
  - Two indexes optimize common access patterns: lookup by entity and filter by model
  - Embeddings are independent from entities - no foreign keys, enables embedding anything
  - Schema version incremented in INSERT OR IGNORE statement at end of schema.sql

## 2026-01-13 - US-021 Eve adapter creates threads from chats
- Modified Eve adapter to sync chats table to threads table before syncing messages
- Added syncChats function that queries Eve chats and creates thread records
- Thread ID format: adapter_name:source_id (e.g., "imessage:chat123")
- Thread name prefers chat_name from Eve, falls back to chat_identifier
- Added ThreadsCreated and ThreadsUpdated fields to SyncResult struct
- Updated sync output display to show thread creation/update counts
- Events already linked to threads via existing thread_id field (no event table changes needed)
- Incremental sync maintains thread references through upsert pattern
- Verified go build succeeds
- **Files changed:**
  - internal/adapters/eve.go (added syncChats function, integrated into Sync flow)
  - internal/adapters/adapter.go (added ThreadsCreated/ThreadsUpdated to SyncResult)
  - internal/sync/sync.go (added thread counts to AdapterResult and job progress)
  - cmd/comms/main.go (added thread counts to sync output display)
  - AGENTS.md (added thread sync patterns to Gotchas)
  - scripts/ralph/progress.txt (added US-021 learnings)
- **Learnings:**
  - Thread sync happens before message sync to ensure thread metadata is available
  - Use ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE for idempotent thread upserts (safe for repeated syncs)
  - Thread creation is separate from message sync for clean separation of concerns
  - Deterministic thread IDs (adapter:source_id) enable consistent references across syncs
  - Thread name can be updated on subsequent syncs if chat_name changes in Eve
  - No need to modify events table - thread_id already exists and is populated correctly
  - Messages query already uses chat_identifier as thread_id via JOIN with chats table
  - SyncResult struct extended without breaking existing adapter implementations
  - Perf tracking includes separate timings for chats.query and chats.tx_commit
  - Thread sync is a separate transaction from message sync for independent failure handling
